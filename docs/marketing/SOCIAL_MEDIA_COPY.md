You can't predict which memecoin will 10x.

But you CAN guarantee you'll save 10% of every trade.

SAS = Auto-savings for Solana traders.

Set it once. Stack forever.

The house always wins. Be the house. 🏦

---

**Tweet 2**:
Last week I:
• Made 50 SOL on BONK ✅
• Lost 30 SOL on WIF ❌  
• Rug pulled on PEPE (-20 SOL) ❌

Net: Break even on trades
Vault: +15 SOL from auto-savings ✅

How? @SolanaAutoSave

You're always winning when you pay yourself first.

---

**Tweet 3**:
Trading memecoins is a zero-sum game.

90% lose money.
10% win but blow it on the next YOLO.

What if you could guarantee a win—regardless of pumps or dumps?

Introducing SAS:
Auto-save 10-20% of EVERY trade to YOUR vault.

Can't paper-hand what's auto-saved. 💎

---

**Tweet 4**:
Honest question:

Do you have more discipline than a literal computer program?

No? Same.

That's why I use @SolanaAutoSave.

Set my rate to 15%. Every trade, 15% gets saved automatically.

I'm still a degen. But now I'm a degen with savings.

---

**Tweet 5**:
POV: You got rugged on a shitcoin

Normal trader: -100 SOL 😭
SAS user: -85 SOL + 15 saved ✅

The rug can't pull what's already in your vault.

Pay yourself first. Trade second.

### Category: Memes & Humor

**Tweet 6**:
Me: "I'm a disciplined trader"

Also me: Apes entire bag into a coin called "DogeElonMoon"

SAS: *silently saves 15% before the rug*

The discipline I don't have, automated. 🤖

**Tweet 7**:
Explaining to my wife how I lost money but also made money:

"Well you see, while I was down 80% on $COPE, my SAS vault was up 12% and—"

Her: "Just show me the vault"

*Shows vault*

Her: "Oh. Carry on then."

**Tweet 8**:
Types of traders:

🦍 The Ape: YOLOs everything, loses everything  
📄 Paper Hands: Sells at -10%, misses the 100x  
💎 Diamond Hands: Holds to zero  
🏦 SAS User: Wins no matter what  

Automate the W.

---

**Tweet 9**:
"I'll just save manually"

*Narrator: They did not save manually*

SAS exists because we know you won't.

And that's okay. We love you anyway. ❤️

---

**Tweet 10**:
Instructions unclear:

1. Set SAS to 20%
2. Degen traded for 3 months
3. Lost 40% on trades
4. Somehow have more SOL than I started with???

Oh. The vault. 

Right. That's the whole point.

**Tweet 11**:
How SAS works (thread) 🧵

1/ You set a savings rate (10-90%)

2/ Every time you trade, that % automatically goes to YOUR vault

3/ Your vault is a PDA (Program Derived Address)—YOU control it, not us

4/ Withdraw anytime. No lock. No BS.

5/ That's it. Seriously.

---

**Tweet 12**:
SAS vs Traditional Savings:

Bank Savings Account:
• 0.01% APY (lol)
• They control your money  
• Can freeze withdrawals  
• Slow transfers

SAS:
• Your keys = your vault
• Withdraw in 400ms
• Non-custodial  
• Transparent on-chain

Not your keys, not your coins. With SAS, it's YOUR PDA.

---

**Tweet 13**:
"Why Solana for auto-savings?"

Speed: 400ms vs Ethereum's 12+ seconds
Cost: $0.00001 vs $5-50 gas fees
UX: Instant savings in SAME transaction as your trade

On Ethereum, saving and trading are separate transactions.

On Solana, they're atomic.

That's the difference.

### Category: Platform Integration Announcements

**Tweet 14**:
🚨 INTEGRATION ALERT 🚨

@Jupiter is now live with SAS!

Every swap = automatic savings to YOUR vault.

To the Jupiter community:
• Set your rate (10-20% recommended)
• Swap like normal
• Watch your vault grow

You're already trading. Now you're saving too.

The house always wins. You're the house now. 🏦

---

**Tweet 15**:
We asked traders: "What would make you actually save?"

The answer: "Make it automatic and invisible"

So we built SAS.

And now @Raydium has integrated it.

Every trade on Raydium = automatic savings.

No extra clicks. No discipline required.

Just set it and forget it.

---

**Tweet 16**:
Breaking: @pumpfun now supports SAS 🎉

For the degen memecoin traders:

Yes, you can keep aping into coins with questionable names.

But now, 10-20% goes to your future self first.

Ape responsibly. Or don't. Either way, you're saving.

### Category: Stats & Milestones

**Tweet 17**:
SAS Stats (Week 1):

• 1,000 vaults created
• 10,000 SOL saved
• 50,000 transactions processed
• 0 rugs pulled (because we can't—it's YOUR vault)

The movement is growing.

Join the winning side. Pay yourself first.

**Tweet 18**:
Month 1 Recap:

📊 5,000 active vaults
💰 75,000 SOL saved (that would've been traded away)
📈 Average savings rate: 14%
🎯 Top saver: 247 SOL in one month

The data is clear: automation works.

Discipline is for computers. Let them handle it.

---

**Tweet 19**:
Real talk:

If 5,000 traders each saved 15 SOL on average...

That's 75,000 SOL that DIDN'T get dumped into the next shitcoin.

That's 75,000 SOL building real wealth.

That's the power of paying yourself first.

"I've been using SAS for 3 months.

Lost ~30 SOL on bad trades.
Made ~80 SOL on good trades.
Vault: 25 SOL saved without thinking.

Net: +75 SOL total.

But without SAS? I'd have probably traded that 25 SOL away too.

This protocol literally saved me from myself."

Shoutout to @SolanaWhale for hitting 500 SOL in their vault 🎉

Started with 10% savings rate 6 months ago.
Never looked back.

"Best decision I made in crypto. I'm still a degen, just a rich degen now."

Who's next to the 500 club?

**Tweet 22**:
Community poll results:

"What's your SAS savings rate?"

• 10-15%: 45%
• 15-20%: 35%
• 20%+: 15%
• I don't use SAS yet (ngmi): 5%

The majority has spoken: 10-20% is the sweet spot.

What's yours?

Three steps to never go broke again:

1. Connect wallet → [link]
2. Set savings rate (start with 10%)
3. Trade like normal

That's it.

Your vault grows automatically.
You win automatically.

Stop losing to yourself. Start today.

**Tweet 24**:
If you're reading this, you've thought about saving.

But you haven't done it.

Why?

Because manual saving requires discipline you don't have.

We get it. No judgment.

That's why we built SAS.

Automate it. Forget about it. Win.

Try it now: [link]

**Tweet 25**:
The best time to start saving was yesterday.

The second best time is right now.

Connect wallet → Set 10% → Done.

Hi [Name],

Quick question: What if you could add a new revenue stream to [Platform] in literally 5 minutes?

I'm reaching out about SAS—Solana Auto-Savings Protocol.

Your users are already trading. What if every trade also automatically saved 10-20% to their personal vault?

**What you get:**
• 0.4% platform fee on all deposits/withdrawals
• Projected revenue: $90k/month (at 5,000 SOL daily volume)
• User retention boost (savers don't leave)
• Competitive differentiation ("The only DEX that helps you save")

**What your users get:**
• Automatic savings on every trade
• Non-custodial PDA vaults (they keep control)
• Withdraw anytime, no lock-ups
• The only guaranteed win in trading

**Integration time**: 5 minutes (seriously)

We've already seen interest from [Platform A] and [Platform B]. I think [Your Platform] would be perfect for this.

Want to see a demo? I'm free [Day/Time] or [Day/Time].

### Template 2: Influencer Partnership Pitch

**Subject**: Partner opportunity: Get paid to help your followers save

Hey [Influencer Name],

Love your content on memecoin trading. Your followers clearly trust your calls.

I'm building SAS—a protocol that helps traders auto-save while they trade.

**The pitch:**

Your followers are probably:
1. Making some trades that win
2. Making some trades that lose
3. Not saving anything because who has time for that?

SAS fixes #3.

**Partnership idea:**

You promote SAS to your audience (tweet thread, video, whatever fits your style)

**You get:**
• Upfront payment: [X SOL]
• Ongoing: 10% of platform fees from your referrals (forever)
• Early access to new features
• Custom referral dashboard

**Your audience gets:**
• Tool that actually helps them build wealth
• Non-custodial (their keys, their vault)
• Simple to use (set it and forget it)

**Example earnings:**

If 500 of your followers use SAS at 10% savings rate with 1,000 SOL monthly volume each:
• That's 500,000 SOL/month processed
• You earn ~200 SOL/month (~$30k) in perpetuity

Sound interesting? Let's chat.

**[VISUAL: Fast cuts of charts pumping and dumping]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"You know what's guaranteed in crypto trading? Losses.

90% of traders lose money. That's not FUD. That's math.

But what if there was ONE thing you could do to guarantee a win—regardless of whether your trades pump or dump?"

**[VISUAL: SAS logo appears]**

"Introducing SAS. Solana Auto-Savings Protocol.

Here's how it works:"

**[VISUAL: Simple animation]**

"1. Set your savings rate. Say, 10%.

2. Every time you trade, 10% automatically goes to YOUR vault.

3. Your vault is a PDA—a Program Derived Address. You control it, not us.

4. Withdraw anytime. No lock-ups. No BS."

**[VISUAL: Vault growing over time]**

"Win on your trades? Great, you saved 10%.

Lose on your trades? Still saved 10%.

Get rugged? Can't rug what's in your vault."

### Video 3: "100 Days of Saving - Documentary" (5 minutes)

**[OPENING SCENE: Trader at computer]**

**NARRATOR:**
"This is Mike. He's a memecoin trader on Solana.

Like 90% of traders, Mike loses money. A lot.

But 100 days ago, Mike tried something different."

**[INTERVIEW - Mike]**

MIKE: "I heard about SAS on Twitter. I was skeptical, honestly. But I figured, what's the worst that could happen? I lose 10% slower?"

**[VISUAL: Mike setting up SAS]**

NARRATOR: "Day 1. Mike set his savings rate to 15%. From that moment on, every trade he made, 15% went straight to his vault."

**[MONTAGE: Charts, trades, wins, losses]**

NARRATOR: "Over the next 100 days, Mike traded 500 SOL. He won some. He lost some. He got rugged twice."

**[INTERVIEW - Mike, Day 50]**

MIKE: "I'm down about 20 SOL on my trades. Classic me. But my vault... my vault has 35 SOL. Wait, how does that work?"

NARRATOR: "Because Mike saved 15% on ALL his volume. Wins AND losses."

**[INTERVIEW - Mike, Day 100]**

MIKE: "Final tally: I lost 30 SOL on my trading P&L. But I saved 75 SOL in my vault. Net result? Up 45 SOL.

Without SAS, I'd be down 30. With SAS, I'm up 45.

That's... that's literally the difference between quitting crypto and staying in the game."

**[CLOSING SCENE: Mike's vault balance on screen]**

NARRATOR: "In the zero-sum game of trading, Mike found a way to win. By paying himself first.

What about you?"

Trading is a zero-sum game. For every winner, there's a loser.

But paying yourself first? That's not zero-sum. That's guaranteed.

Whether you trade with us or not, just... start saving. Your future self will thank you.

Thanks to [Influencers] for joining.

And remember: In the game of trading, the house always wins.

Peace out."
